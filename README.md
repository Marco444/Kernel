# Kernel

This project is a basic kernel for Intel 64 bits architecture designed as an interactive shell that allows to run commands simultaneously in split screen. 

The main goal of the project is in the design, clearly defining a kernel and user space, managing the interaction between kernel/hardware and kernel/user through interruptions, and implementing an schedluer to manage context switching and thus running commands simultaneously.
